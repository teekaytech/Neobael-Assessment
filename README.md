# Neobael Assesssment (Responsive Web Page)

In this project, I developed a single HTML page, with the CSS embedded within the HTML file, and also responsive when rendered on different view ports, be it desktop or mobile.

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Media Queries)
- Webhint / Stylelint (Linters)
- GitHub Pages (Deployment)

### Live demo: [Live Demo Link](https://teekaytech.github.io/Neobael-Assessment/)

## Getting started

**I developed the page with mobile-first responsiveness in mind. I was able to embed the image while following the project specifications. I used media queries to take care of the responsiveness on tablet and desktop screen sizes. The Design specification can be found [here](t.ly/09hO)**
